# BrushidoApp
Course Work Project for my Computer Graphics class @FMI Plovdiv University, written in 24 hours.

## Course Work Tasks
 - [X] Create an image using different vector primitives - dots, lines, polygons, ellipses, etc.
 - [X] Visualize the primitives based on their visualization features such as as - color, line thickness, transparency, etc.
 - [X] Indication of a graphic primitive from the image (Save Painting)
 - [X] Manipulation of graphic primitives - for example moving, rotating, scaling, etc.
 - [X] Creating an image structure by grouping different elements (select multiple / group)
 - [X] Manipulation of groups - moving, rotating, scaling, etc
 - [ ] Different ways of defining the characteristics of objects in an image - for example, assigning a color by its name, naming the objects in the image, etc.
 - [X] Various ways of setting user operations - for example, through menus, buttons, mouse, etc.
 - [X] Support for a wide range of image editing operations such as adding items, removing items, copying, updating features, hierarchical grouping, grouping and etc.
 - [ ] Different options for selecting object(s) from the image
 - [ ] Using multi-window  technique to support multiple views of the same image, and to work with multiple images at the same time
 - [X] Different options for reading / writing the image model from / to external media.
 
 Personal TODO:
 - [X] Add Brush Work / Airbrush
 - [X] Add Brush Stroke
 - Add Key Combos
 - Add Undo/Redo
